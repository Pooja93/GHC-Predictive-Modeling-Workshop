Hi - Thanks for your interested in the predictive analytics workshop. We hope to see you at GHC !! 

Python setup (This should work for windows/linux/mac platforms): 
1. You need to install Anaconda that comes with the correct version of python and all required data science libraries including numpy and scipy and scikit-learn.

You can download and install anaconda by following instructions on this page. 
https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install

During the install you must add the Anaconda bin directory to your path.

Open a new terminal, and check if anaconda is installed correctly, and works.
> conda list
# Will show you a list of packages installed

# On Mac & Linux, type
> which python 
# To make sure the Anaconda version of python is running on your system
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Go to the command line to the directory of anaconda installation. You need to update scikit-learn from anaconda by running the command : 

> conda list scikit-learn
# Will show scikit-learn 0.17

> conda update scikit-learn
# Will download and install new version of scikit-learn

> conda list scikit-learn
# This will show the installed version 
# Make sure you have version 0.18.1 for scikit-learn
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Go to the directory where you have downloaded the GHC workshop material. You will have files ghc_test.py and the data file movie_metadata.csv here. Run the test file as follows. 

> python ghc_test.py 
# You should get output without any errors and see a success message

Congrats! You are now ready for the workshop.
